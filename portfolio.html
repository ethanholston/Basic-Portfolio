    <h1 >About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Ethan Holston. I was born in Indiana, raised in Arizona, and spent some time in Colorado before making my way out to North Carolina. I currently work for CenturyLink as a UCC technician, but will be starting with a new company soon. I like to hike, offroad in my Jeep, and hang out with my 2 dogs and wife. </p>
